# DSA---internship-portal-prototype

Project Overview
This project is a prototype of an Internship Portal designed to simplify the internship application and management process for students, employers, and administrators. The portal includes four key modules: Job Management, which allows admins to post and update internship listings; Applicant Management, which tracks student applications and profiles; Matching Engine, which automatically pairs applicants with suitable positions based on skills and preferences; and Interview Arrangement, which helps schedule and manage interviews. Built using Java, this prototype is intended to be opened and modified in Apache NetBeans.

Installation Guide
1. Downloading Apache NetBeans
To run this project, you will need to install Apache NetBeans IDE. Start by visiting the official Apache NetBeans website at https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html. Download the "Apache NetBeans (Java SE)" version that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the setup instructions. Ensure you have Java JDK installed, as NetBeans may require it. After installation, launch NetBeans from your applications menu.

2. Downloading and Setting Up the Project
The project is available as a ZIP file. Download it from the provided source (e.g., GitHub or a file-sharing link) and save it to your preferred location. Extract the ZIP file by right-clicking it and selecting "Extract All", then choose a destination folder. Open Apache NetBeans, go to File → Open Project, and navigate to the extracted folder to load the project. If the project is hosted on a Git repository, you can also clone it using the command git clone [repository-url] before opening it in NetBeans.

Running the Project
Before running the project, ensure all dependencies, such as external libraries (e.g., JDBC for database connectivity), are properly linked in NetBeans. To compile the code, right-click the project in the Projects tab and select "Build". Once built, run the project by selecting "Run". Depending on the implementation, the application will launch as a desktop or web interface.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, first check whether you have the latest Java JDK installed. If you see a "JDK not found" error, download it from Oracle’s official website. Missing libraries may cause compilation errors, so verify that all required JAR files are added under "Libraries" in NetBeans. If the project uses a database, ensure it is running and that the connection details in the code are correct.
